``mrinversion`` has the following strict requirements:

- `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ 3.6 or later

Make sure you have the required version of python by typing the following in the

.. tip::
    You may also click the copy-button located at the top-right corner of the code cell
    area in the HTML docs, to copy the code lines without the prompts and then paste it
    as usual.

.. code-block:: shell

      $ python --version

For *Mac* users, python version 3 may be installed under the name *python3*. You may replace
*python* for *python3* in the above command and all subsequent python statements.

Installing ``mrinversion``
--------------------------

On Google Colab Notebook
''''''''''''''''''''''''

Colaboratory is a Google research project. It is a Jupyter notebook environment that
runs entirely in the cloud. Launch a new notebook on
`Colab <http://colab.research.google.com>`_. To install the mrinversion package, type

.. code-block:: shell

    !pip install mrinversion

in the first cell, and execute. All done! You may now proceed to the next section and
start using the library.


On Local machine (Using pip)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The ``mrinversion`` package utilizes the `mrsimulator <https://mrsimulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
package for generating the NMR line-shapes.

For **Linux** and **Mac** users, type the following in the terminal to install the
package.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install mrinversion

For **Windows** users, first, `install <https://mrsimulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#on-local-machine-using-pip>`_
the mrsimulator package and then install the mrinversion package using the above command.

If you get a ``PermissionError``, it usually means that you do not have the required
administrative access to install new packages to your Python installation. In this
case, you may consider adding the ``--user`` option, at the end of the statement, to
install the package into your home directory. You can read more about how to do this in
the `pip documentation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install mrinversion --user

Upgrading to a newer version
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To upgrade, type the following in the terminal/Prompt,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install mrinversion -U
